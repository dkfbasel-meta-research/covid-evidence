# COVID-evidence
**COVID-evidence** is a continuously updated database of the worldwide available evidence on interventions for COVID-19.

We provide information about worldwide planned, ongoing, and completed randomized controlled trials on any intervention to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2-infections.

## The Mission
With this freely available continuously updated database, we aim to concentrate all available trial evidence on benefits and harms of interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in an easy-accessible manner.

**COVID-evidence** is a non-profit initiative of the Department of Clinical Research at University of Basel and the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford with other international partners and collaborators.

We aim to provide a reliable starting point for those who need to make treatment decisions, plan new trials, or develop clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews.

**COVID-evidence** collects up-to-date trial information as well as links to original sources such as study protocol documents, registry entries, and publications. The COVID-evidence database is used to foster collaboration and evidence generation on COVID-19 such as our rapid reviews on mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine or on convalescent plasma.

## The Evidence
We consider reports, registry entries, and manuscripts of trials with various designs. Eligible are trials testing any interventions actively allocated to humans to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2-infections. Interventions include drug and non-drug treatments, diagnostic procedures, and decision-algorithms.

We include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on geographical regions or settings.

## The Details
Current data sources:
- For trial registry entries: Systematic searches in [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and the [WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform).
- For publications and preprints: Systematic searches in the [LÂ·OVE platform](https://iloveevidence.com/) of all randomized controlled trials reporting results. The platform covers PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv and many other data sources.
