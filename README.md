## Project
### The Mission
With this freely available continuously updated database, we aim to concentrate all available trial evidence on benefits and harms of interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in an easy-accessible manner.

**COVID-evidence** is a non-profit initiative of the Department of Clinical Research at University of Basel and the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford with other international partners and collaborators.

We aim to provide a reliable starting point for those who need to make treatment decisions, plan new trials, or develop clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews.

**COVID-evidence** collects up-to-date trial information as well as links to original sources such as study protocol documents, registry entries, and publications. The COVID-evidence database is used to foster collaboration and evidence generation on COVID-19 such as our rapid reviews on mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine or on convalescent plasma.

### The Evidence
We consider reports, registry entries, and manuscripts of trials with various designs. Eligible are trials testing any interventions actively allocated to humans to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2-infections. Interventions include drug and non-drug treatments, diagnostic procedures, and decision-algorithms.

We include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on geographical regions or settings.

### The Details
Current data sources:
- For trial registry entries: Systematic searches in [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and the [WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform).
- For publications and preprints: Systematic searches in the [L·OVE platform](https://iloveevidence.com/) of all randomized controlled trials reporting results. The platform covers PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv and many other data sources.

Trial information that is not included in these sources may also be added to COVID-evidence as 'handsearch results'. We will continuously refine the screening processes and transparently document the underlying methods in the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/gehfx/) (OSF; DOI 10.17605/[OSF.IO/GEHFX](https://osf.io/gehfx/))

**Full protocol** on [OSF](https://osf.io/gehfx/) (V5.0; 1 February 2022).

### The Updates
The COVID-evidence database now focuses on reporting key characteristics of randomized controlled trials such as status, design features, the clinical question (i.e. the population, compared interventions, key outcomes), and setting. We are using the COVID-evidence database as a collaborative platform to foster evidence generation (Publications/Projects).

### The fate of randomized clinical trials registered in the first 100 days
Between October 5 and 15, 2020, all trial groups of randomized clinical trials registered in the first 100 days were invited to share information on recruitment status, enrollment accrual, reasons for trial termination or discontinuation (if applicable), and any results reporting. Additional publications of RCTS reporting results were systematically searched using the Living Overview of Evidence (LOVE) platform.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is COVID-evidence BASIC?
It is a comprehensive dataset with basic information on all randomized clinical trials to treat or prevent COVID-19 included in the [database](https://covid-evidence.org/database).

### What is the data flow?
The WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov are searched and imported automatically whereas the L·OVE platform is searched manually. After conversion to a standard format, all entries are assigned to a  screening collection (i.e. dataset). The collections ensure transparency and reproducibility of each steps of the data flow.

All entries are screened for eligibility (automatically for the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov collections and manually for the L·OVE platform collection).

Following automatic de-duplication and data extraction, eligible entries are indexed in the Cove BASIC collection. The variables of entries retrieved from the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov are automatically updated on a weekly basis, when applicable.

Entries that are related to the same trial are linked and stored in the linked trials collection.

Entries included in COVID-evidence BASIC collection are further manually screened, verifying their eligibility. Manual extraction and data verification of automatic data extraction are done for “Expansion Modules” that go beyond the collection of basic information of trials.

In the COVID-evidence database, entries and all related information are made publicly available.

### How reliable are filters?
Filters provide a fast access related to users’ specific interests and in large majority are automatically populated based on information available in the database. The filters are designed to focus on trial characteristics and important clinical questions (topics). Filters on trial characteristics are based on automatic data extraction and processing. 

Filters on “Vaccine” and “Post-acute COVID” topics are based on keyword searches in title and intervention field of a trial entry. Trials retrieved by the topic “Preventive non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)” are manually identified in our data set and restricted to registry entries. Details on filters are provided in our protocol on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/gehfx/). 

### What are “Expansion Modules”?
Expansion modules aim to address more detailed questions that go beyond the collection of basic information of trials.

The modular concept allows targeting emerging needs for example by extracting in-depth information for only a subset of trials (e.g. trials assessing hydroxychloroquine or convalescent plasma), or for a certain population (e.g. children only), or country of origin. International collaborations and close interactions with various trial teams are the cornerstone of our expansion modules aiming at providing rapid answers to important clinical questions.

### Do you share your data?
All data can be downloaded for free on our [database](https://covid-evidence.org/database) page. Our protocol and other relevant projects can be accessed on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/gehfx/).

### How accurate is the data?
We aim to provide data of highest standard through duplicate extractions and by keeping our methods transparent. We focus on automatic extractions with continuously evolving filters due to the unprecedented growth of accumulating trial information. We present the current status of the data in the “status of review” column, marking automatic extractions (“automatic”), ongoing manual extraction (“in manual extraction”), and fulfilled manual extraction (“manual extraction completed”. Specific information on topics covered by expansion modules is available via specific filters.

### Do you work with other initiatives?
Yes, we are in contact with several initiatives whose aims overlap with ours. For example, we have partnered with the [Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform](https://iloveevidence.com/) for COVID-19 that facilitates our tracking of publications and preprints of randomized controlled trials assessing an intervention to treat or prevent COVID-19.

### What makes COVID-evidence different from other initiatives?
Examples of other efforts to summarize the literature on COVID-19 are presented [here](https://covid-evidence.org/related-research). Some overlap exists, mainly for COVID-evidence BASIC. We aim to make use of them in order to increase data reliability and work efficiency. We would like to emphasize the following COVID-evidence characteristics:
- We apply highest-standard systematic review methods.
- Beyond tracking trial registries, we integrate manual data extraction by experienced meta-researchers for specific fields with special importance.
- We have a broad definition of trials included – not only drug treatments.
- Trials are included all across their lifespan – from planned to published.
- We integrate information from different sources, including fulltexts, and our reviewer team has native speakers of several languages (e.g., English, Chinese, French, German, and Dutch).
- We have created strong international collaborations with trial teams.

### Where do I find more details on COVID-evidence?
For more details on our work, please visit our full protocol on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/gehfx/) (OSF; DOI [10.17605/OSF.IO/GEHFX](https://osf.io/gehfx/)). We aim to continuously upload our updated methods and processes.

### Who is paying?
This is a non-profit initiative. The project is funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://p3.snf.ch/project-196190) (project 31CA30_196190). The members of the COVID-evidence core team are supported by our institutions at the [University of Basel (DKF)](https://dkf.unibas.ch/en/pages/) and [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
