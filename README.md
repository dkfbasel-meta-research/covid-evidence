# COVID-evidence
**COVID-evidence** is a continuously updated database of the worldwide available evidence on interventions for COVID-19.

We provide information about worldwide planned, ongoing, and completed randomized controlled trials on any intervention to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2-infections.

## Project
### The Mission
With this freely available continuously updated database, we aim to concentrate all available trial evidence on benefits and harms of interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in an easy-accessible manner.

**COVID-evidence** is a non-profit initiative of the Department of Clinical Research at University of Basel and the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford with other international partners and collaborators.

We aim to provide a reliable starting point for those who need to make treatment decisions, plan new trials, or develop clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews.

**COVID-evidence** collects up-to-date trial information as well as links to original sources such as study protocol documents, registry entries, and publications. The COVID-evidence database is used to foster collaboration and evidence generation on COVID-19 such as our rapid reviews on mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine or on convalescent plasma.

### The Evidence
We consider reports, registry entries, and manuscripts of trials with various designs. Eligible are trials testing any interventions actively allocated to humans to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2-infections. Interventions include drug and non-drug treatments, diagnostic procedures, and decision-algorithms.

We include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on geographical regions or settings.

### The Details
Current data sources:
- For trial registry entries: Systematic searches in [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and the [WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform).
- For publications and preprints: Systematic searches in the [L·OVE platform](https://iloveevidence.com/) of all randomized controlled trials reporting results. The platform covers PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv and many other data sources.

Trial information that is not included in these sources may also be added to COVID-evidence as 'handsearch results'. We will continuously refine the screening processes and transparently document the underlying methods in the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/gehfx/) (OSF; DOI 10.17605/[OSF.IO/GEHFX](https://osf.io/gehfx/))

**Full protocol** on [OSF](https://osf.io/gehfx/) (V5.0; 1 February 2022).

### The Updates
The COVID-evidence database now focuses on reporting key characteristics of randomized controlled trials such as status, design features, the clinical question (i.e. the population, compared interventions, key outcomes), and setting. We are using the COVID-evidence database as a collaborative platform to foster evidence generation (Publications/Projects).

### Trials assessing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to prevent COVID-19
A systematic scoping review of registered randomized trials assessing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to prevent COVID-19 as of August 2021 summarizing key trial characteristics and presenting results:

Additionally, a blog spotlight has been published:

Why we urgently need a long-term research agenda on non-pharmaceutical interventions to guide policies and practices in the current and future public health emergencies.

A [living overview](https://covid-evidence.org/database?page=npi) on registered trials assessing NPIs to prevent COVID-19 was launched as part of COVID-evidence. The protocol is published on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/fq9jh/).

### Analysis of the COVID-19 research agenda in Germany
A systematic analysis of randomized clinical trials assessing interventions to treat or prevent COVID-19 that were registered in 2020 and recruited or planned to recruit participants in Germany. Additionally, we requested recruitment accrual information from trial investigators as of April 2021.

### Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine collaborative review
An international collaborative meta-analysis on the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on mortality outcomes in patients with COVID-19 from all available RCTs by October 16, 2020. In addition to published data, investigators from all ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs were invited to share their unpublished mortality data.

### The fate of randomized clinical trials registered in the first 100 days
Between October 5 and 15, 2020, all trial groups of randomized clinical trials registered in the first 100 days were invited to share information on recruitment status, enrollment accrual, reasons for trial termination or discontinuation (if applicable), and any results reporting. Additional publications of RCTS reporting results were systematically searched using the Living Overview of Evidence (LOVE) platform.
